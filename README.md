# Image Classification with Vision Transformer
The Vision Transformer, introduced in the paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale" by Dosovitskiy et al., presents a novel approach to image understanding by leveraging the Transformer architecture, which has achieved significant success in natural language processing tasks.

# Overview
In this repository, we delve into the implementation and experimentation of Vision Transformer models for image classification. The Vision Transformer breaks from the traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) paradigm by casting image classification as a sequence-to-sequence problem. Instead of using convolutions, it processes image patches as input tokens and applies self-attention mechanisms to capture global and local dependencies within the image.
